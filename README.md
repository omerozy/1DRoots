# 1D Roots of Equation

Algorithms are developed with the purpose of utilizing numerical root finding methods for any function f : R ‚ü∂ R

Methods impelemented:

1. Bisecton Method
2. False-Poisiton Method
3. Fixed-Point Iteration
4. Newton-Raphson mehod
5. Secant Method

## Bisecton Method

Incremental search method in which the interval is divided in half and the subinterval within which the sign change occurs is used at each iteration

## False-Poisiton Method

## Fixed-Point Iteration

## Newton-Raphson mehod

## Secant Method
