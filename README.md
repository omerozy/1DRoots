# 1D Roots of Equation

Algorithms are developed with the purpose of utilizing numerical root finding methods for any function f : R ‚ü∂ R

Methods implemented:

1. Bisection Method
2. False-Position Method
3. Fixed-Point Iteration
4. Newton-Raphson mehod
5. Secant Method

## Bisection Method

Incremental search method in which the interval is divided in half and the subinterval within which the sign change occurs is used at each iteration

## False-Position Method

Similar to bisection method with the difference in dividing approach of subintervals

## Fixed-Point Iteration

Open method using the formula obtained by manipulating the objective function

## Newton-Raphson mehod

Widely used method utilizing the derivative of the objective function

## Secant Method

Similar to Newton-Raphson but utilizes backward finite divided difference for the objective function derivative instead of using the derivative function given as input
